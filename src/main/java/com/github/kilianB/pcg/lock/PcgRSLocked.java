/**
 * A 64 bit State PcgRNG with 32 bit output. PCG-XSH-RR <p>
 * 
 * The pcg family combines a linear congruential generators with a permutation
 * output function resulting in high quality pseudo random numbers. <p>
 * 
 * The original concept was introduced by Melissa Oâ€™Neill please refer to <a
 * href="http://www.pcg-random.org/">pcg-random</a> for more information. <p>
 * Opposed to RR this version performs a random shift rather than a random
 * rotation.
 * 
 * The RS instance permutates the output using the following function:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * ((state >>> 22) ^ state) >>> ((state >>> 61) + 22)
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This implementation is thread safe utilizing read write locks. During non contested
 * periods this version performs considerably slower and only gains the upper hand
 * if the synchronized parts are hammered consistently.
