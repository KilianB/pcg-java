/**
 * Base interface for all PCG random generators.
 * 
 * The PCG family uses a linear congruential generator as the state-transition
 * function—the “CG” of PCG stands for “congruential generator”. Linear
 * congruential generators are known to be statistically weak. <p>
 * 
 * PCG uses a new technique called permutation functions on tuples to produce
 * output that is much more random than the RNG's internal state. The output
 * function is defined by the extending classes. <p>
 * 
 * A paper highlighting the individual properties can be found here. <a
 * href="http://www.pcg-random.org/paper.html">http://www.pcg-random.org/paper.html</a>.
 * This class is an adaption to the original c <a
 * href="https://github.com/imneme/pcg-c">source code</a> provided by M.E.
 * O'Neill.
